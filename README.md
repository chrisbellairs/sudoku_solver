Rails app generated alongside a Postgres database.

Generated puzzle model with a column for each puzzle cell.

Generated puzzles controller.

Opted for just the one class of puzzle. Considered also creating a puzzle_solver class for the sake of single responsibility, but felt the application was simple enough that it would not take much effort to seperate the tasks in the future if needed.

Created routes index, new, create and show routes for puzzles.
